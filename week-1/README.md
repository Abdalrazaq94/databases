## Learning Objectives

- Familiarize some theoretical concepts: information systems, databases, RDMBs, relational models, tables, records, attributes, fields and keys
- Learn how to navigate a (SQLite) database
- Learn how to write basic SQL queries using following statements: `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, `SELECT DISTINCT`, `WHERE`, `LIMIT`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`.
- Using the `sqlite3` module in your node apps

## Prep Work

> Before Sunday Class:
> - [Review the Weekly Assignments guide](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/weekly-assignments)
> - [Create your Homework Issue](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/homework-submission#homework-issues)

The goal is to make this a very hands-on class. Nonetheless it's important to familiarize yourself with some theoretical concepts surrounding databases before diving in.

- [PREPWORK.md](./PREPWORK.md)

Extra resources:

- [SQLite Tutorial - An Easy Way to Master SQLite Fast](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
This is a very nice tutorial website which, surprise surprise, uses the same sample database as we use.

### Project

#### `repo-name`

> [project type](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/homework-submission#projects)

This week's project is to study the [link to project (starter repo, tutorial, ...)](_).  _more about the project, what it covers, any extra info_

You will be expected to turn in your code from his tutorial on a new repository called `repo-name`.  This should be a complete project repository including:

- A `development-strategy.md` file to explain how you built the app in small pieces (this file doesn't need to match the tutorial!)
- One branch per step in your `development-strategy.md`
- _something about how to organize the code_
- _any more requirements_

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, the organization of your code, and the completeness of your README.
